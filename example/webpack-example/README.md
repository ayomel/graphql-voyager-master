Example GraphQL-Voyager Install
========================

This example uses the version of GraphQL-Voyager found in the parent directory, rather
than depending on npm, so that it is easier to test new changes. In order to use
the compiled version of GraphQL-Voyager, first run in the parent directory before
installing and starting the example.

1. Run `npm install && npm run build:release` in the root repo directory
2. Navigate to this directory (example) in Terminal
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. Open your browser to the address listed in your console. e.g. `Project is running at http://localhost:9090/`
